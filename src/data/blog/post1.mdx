Using MDX provides several benefits:

- **Interactive Content**: Embed interactive components and visualizations directly within your Markdown.
- **Component Reusability**: Reuse React components across multiple Markdown files.
- **Dynamic Content**: Generate dynamic content using JavaScript and React within Markdown.

## Getting Started

To start using MDX in your project, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install MDX Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install @mdx-js/react
   ```
